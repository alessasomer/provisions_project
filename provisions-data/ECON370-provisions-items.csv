Iconic - the world's most awarded Malbecs come from Alamos, Mendoza Argentina. Winemaker Lucia Vaieretti has four young daughters - the next generation in a 100-year old family business.

The winemaker says, ""Our 2020 Malbec is a robust symphony of dark fruit that captures the complexity of Mendoza’s iconic varietal. The color shows inky purple with a halo of black tulip. Pronounced notes of black cherry and blackberry integrate with finely grained spice and vanilla oak. Notes of wild berries and round tannins fill out the palate, leading to a long and velvety smooth finish with a touch of dried herbs. Delicious with wood-fired meat. A warm growing season during 2020 accelerated ripening and led to the earliest harvest on record. As a result, the berries harvested were small with expressive, concentrated flavors and ideal acidity.""",Wine,085000018194,visible,Prepared food and beverage,N,N,Y,Y,15.00,N,N,9.33,28,Y,12,N,N

Austin Hope Cabernet Sauvignon is a rich and bold wine that showcases the best of Paso Robles, California. This full-bodied red wine is crafted by the Hope family, who have been cultivating grapes in the region for over 40 years. The wine is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, and Petit Verdot grapes, which are harvested by hand and aged in French oak barrels for 15 months.
On the nose, Austin Hope Cabernet Sauvignon offers intense aromas of dark fruit, including blackberry and black cherry, as well as hints of vanilla and toasty oak. On the palate, the wine is robust and layered, with flavors of ripe blackberry, cassis, and chocolate. The tannins are firm and well-structured, providing a long and satisfying finish.
Overall, Austin Hope Cabernet Sauvignon is a powerful wine that delivers a true taste of Paso Robles. It pairs well with hearty dishes, such as grilled steak or roasted lamb, and is perfect for sipping on a cold winter's night.",Wine,657891715591,visible,Prepared food and beverage,N,N,N,Y,70.00,N,N,44.34,6,Y,12,N,N

Beyra Vin Blanc is a white wine that was discovered in a rather unique way - through a distributor's contest for a trip to Portugal. While not the typical way to choose a wine, we are happy to report that Beyra Vin Blanc has proven to be a delicious and popular choice among our customers. Upon applying our sophisticated wine evaluation skills, we found that this wine has a crisp acidity and a refreshing minerality, with subtle flavors of citrus and tropical fruit.
This wine is made from a blend of grapes, including Fonte Cal, Siria, and Arinto, grown in the remote region of Beira Interior in Portugal. The vineyards are located at a high altitude, which contributes to the wine's unique flavor profile. Beyra Vin Blanc is fermented in stainless steel tanks and aged on lees, resulting in a wine that is both elegant and complex.
Overall, Beyra Vin Blanc is a testament to the fact that sometimes the best discoveries can come from unexpected places. It's a wine that has proven to be a hit with our customers",Wine,5609851522119,visible,Prepared food and beverage,N,N,N,Y,14.00,N,N,8.66,17,Y,12,N,N

The Fontechiara Colline Novaresi Vespolina is aged in oak barrels for 12 months, resulting in a complex and well-structured wine with notes of red fruits, spices, and a hint of earthiness. It pairs well with rich dishes such as roasted meats, stews, and hearty pasta dishes.

Mussels from the Galician coast are prepared in one of the most genuine sauces in Spain, escabeche, which is made with paprika, vinegar, oil, garlic, and bay leaves.

like a party in a bottle - and I don't mean one of those boring dinner parties on Buckley St. where everyone sits around talking about the weather. I'm talking about a wild, crazy, no-holds-barred rager that you'll never forget.
One sip of Iuli Natalin and you'll feel like you're dancing on the table at the British Maid, singing at the top of your lungs, and wearing a lampshade on your head (even if you're actually just sitting quietly at home in your pajamas).
It's the kind of wine that makes you want to call up your ex and tell them how much you miss them, even though you know it's a terrible idea. And when you wake up the next morning with a headache and a vague sense of regret, you'll still be glad you tried it - because let's face it, life is too short to drink boring wine.",Wine,8052400330043,visible,Prepared food and beverage,N,N,N,Y,21.00,N,N,16,13,N,5,N,N

Julien Sunier Fleurie is a red wine made from Gamay grapes grown in the Fleurie appellation of Beaujolais, France. The wine is produced by Julien Sunier, a young winemaker known for his minimalist approach to winemaking and his commitment to organic and biodynamic farming practices.
The Fleurie appellation is known for producing some of the most elegant and aromatic wines in Beaujolais, and Sunier's Fleurie is no exception. The wine is light and fruity, with flavors of red berries, cherries, and violets, and a subtle earthy undertone. It has a smooth and silky texture, with well-integrated tannins and a refreshing acidity.
Sunier's winemaking philosophy is based on respecting the natural character of the grapes and the terroir, and his Fleurie reflects this approach. The grapes are harvested by hand and fermented with native yeasts, with minimal intervention during the winemaking process. The wine is then aged in oak barrels for a few months before bottling, allowing it to develop its complex and nuan",Wine,3760248250021,visible,Prepared food and beverage,N,N,N,Y,37.00,N,N,25,0,Y,12,N,N

Size: 3.23oz (120 g)
Ingredients: mackerel, sunflower oil, tomato, onion, salt.
Product of Spain

Clean mackerel fillets, with no bone, in tomato sauce.
After being cooked in seawater, La Narval dries the mackerel a little bit so that when it gets in contact with the sauce, it gets re-hydrated again increasing its taste and texture.
Exquisite fish high in B6 and B12 vitamins.

Suggested recipe: mackerel tacos.
Heat a wheat tortilla for five seconds in the microwave. Add lettuce, tomato slices, corn, and cheese. 
Place the mackerel fillets and the tomato sauce on top. Add your favorite spicy sauce.

Ramey is a California winery renowned for producing high-quality Chardonnay wines. The winery is located in Healdsburg, Sonoma County, which is known for its diverse soil types and maritime climate. These factors contribute to the unique character of Ramey's Chardonnay.
The winemaking philosophy of Ramey is centered around the concept of terroir, or the influence of the environment on the wine. The grapes used for their Chardonnay are sourced from several different vineyards, each with its own distinct soil composition and microclimate. This allows the winemaker to create a blend of Chardonnay that represents the best of each terroir.
The grapes are hand-harvested and sorted before being gently pressed, and the juice is fermented using native yeasts. The wine is aged in French oak barrels for 12-18 months, during which time it undergoes malolactic fermentation. This process helps to soften the acidity and impart a creamy texture to the wine.

On the nose, this wine offers aromas of dark fruit, including blackberry, black cherry, and cassis, with a hint of vanilla and spice. On the palate, it is full-bodied and complex, with flavors of ripe fruit, espresso, and chocolate, framed by firm tannins and a long, smooth finish.

Small Sardines in Olive Oil. 10/12 small sardines per tin.
Sardinillas en Aceite de Oliva
Size: 4.23oz (120 g)
Ingredients: sardines, olive oil, salt.
Product of Spain

Up to 12 sardines per tin in olive oil. Small and full of taste. This is a blue fish with a high quantity of Omega 3 acids which help to lower the cholesterol levels. After being cooked in seawater, we dry it a little bit so that when it gets in contact with the sauce, it gets re-hydrated again increasing its taste and texture.

Suggested recipe: sardine salad.
Slice one tomato. Place the sardines on top of the tomato slice. Dress with the olive oil from the sardines. Garnish with a sprig of parsley.

Swick Pinot Noir is a delicious and elegant red wine made by winemaker Joe Swick, who is known for his natural winemaking style. This wine is produced from Pinot Noir grapes grown in the Willamette Valley of Oregon, which is known for its ideal growing conditions for this grape variety.
On the nose, Swick Pinot Noir offers enticing aromas of ripe red fruit, such as cherry and raspberry, with subtle hints of spice and earth. On the palate, it is medium-bodied and silky, with flavors of red fruit, plum, and a touch of herbal notes. The wine is well-balanced with fine tannins and a long, smooth finish.
Swick Pinot Noir is produced using traditional winemaking methods, such as native yeast fermentation, with minimal intervention to preserve the natural flavors and aromas of the grapes. The wine is aged in neutral oak barrels, which allows the fruit flavors to shine through without being overpowered by oak.
This wine is versatile and pairs well with a variety of foods, such as roasted chicken, grilled salm",Wine,NA,unavailable,Prepared food and beverage,N,N,N,Y,24.00,Y,N,18,0,Y,24,N,N
